information for two example gene processed according to asSeq pipeline, includes
+ Tcnt_ex.dat - total read counts
+ A1_ex.dat - allele specific counts from parent 1
+ A2_ex.dat - allele specific counts from parent 2
+ Info_ex.dat - gene information file
+ samples.dat - design matrix information including log(sample depth) and several PCs

Files Tcnt_ex.dat and samples.dat will be reformatted to be used by RASQUAL: Y.bin, X.bin and K.bin

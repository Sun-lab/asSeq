Includes results of SNP imputation within 200k of two genes used of example in VCF format

+ vcf - contains produced with previous pipeline in TReCASE style
+ vcfr - contains vcf file from vcf folder with SNP level allele-specific counts produced by ASEReadCounter attached to the SNP RASQUAL style
+ vcfp - if you run permutation step it would create a folder similar to vcfr, but with permuted SNPs

1. This folder compares discrepant results from TReCASE and RASQUAL model.
significant_combined_spline.png show dependency of fraction of significant genes (at a cutoff listed in the legend) given that in other model they are significant (panels (a) and (b)) and given that in other model they are not significant (panels (c) and (d))
- The results are plotted vs number of fSNPs, spline-smoothed. 

2. lm_upd.docx gives linear model fit vs several statistics produced by RASQUAL, two over-dispersion parameters, median p-value for RASQUAL refitted on permuted SNPs and ratio of fraction allele-specific reads using RASQUAL vs allele-specific reads using TReCASE

# TP53 target genes.

This list of TP53 target genes were collected from Supplementary Table 3 of 

Fischer M. Census and evaluation of p53 target genes. Oncogene. 2017 Jul;36(28):3943-56.

"To be considered as high-confidence p53 target gene, a protein-coding gene was required to be identified as a p53-activated target in at least three of the 17 data sets, which ensures identification by at least two independent approaches. These criteria were met by 343 genes (Supplementary Table S3). "
